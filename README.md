Hi!

My academic training is predominantly in cancer bioinformatics and computational biology.

- I'm currently a Programmer/Analyst with Population Data BC, where I design and implement improvements to our Python and C-based data linkage algorithms.

- I've worked in both dry and wet labs, using techniques ranging from sequencing read alignment and random forest classifiers to qRT-PCR and protein purification. You can find links to my research on topics such as post-transcriptional microRNA modifications within lung tumours on my Google Scholar page, which is linked in the left sidebar. 

- I've always enjoyed turning my analytical eye onto my hobbies as well, and so you can find some statistical explorations of baseball and football in my pinned repositories, below.
